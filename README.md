# Approve an Install Plan

## Overview

This repository provides a Kubernetes job that automates the approval process for pending InstallPlans generated by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) for Kubernetes operators.

If you have set an operator with the update strategy to manual, you need to manually approve the initial deployment for the operator resources. This can be a challenging task to control and manage all the deployed operators in a GitOps way. This job automates the approval process for all pending install plans in the namespace in which it is deployed, making it easier to manage your Kubernetes resources.
